# Replace points and board game coins with Vs. and save annoying counting

Let's be honest: Most of the time you spend with board games consists of 50% playing, 30% trading, counting and changing of in-game currencies and the rest of reading the manual. Has it to be that way? Yes and no. We obviously can’t explain the introduction of the game to you, but we can take the burden of the in-game currency of you. Vs. is like a  banking account for board games, only that you don't have to insert a card or tap somewhere.

<b>„Trust, but verify“</b>
We handle everybody’s Scores very carefully. No cloud, no server, no analytics. Everything stays local on your device. But: "With great power comes great responsibility". If you throw your phone in the next river your score is gone, too. Don't say we didn't warn you. Do you still don't trust us? Vs. is open source. That means you can inspect every single character of code. Just go to https://github.com/LeLuxNet/Vs.

<b>Upcoming Features:</b>
